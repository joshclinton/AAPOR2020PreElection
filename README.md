# AAPOR2020PreElection
Data and Analysis from AAPOR Task Force on 2020 Pre-Election Polls

Included is the data and code used to analyze 2020 pre-election polls by the AAPOR Task Force on 2020 Pre-Election polling. 

The final report is located [here](https://www.aapor.org/Education-Resources/Reports/2020-Pre-Election-Polling-An-Evaluation-of-the-202.aspx).

A few notes on this data.

1) The code is not well-documented as it was being done in the midst of the pandemic while trying to juggle my actual job and family. It is not the most elegant or efficient.

2) The data included in 2020 General Election Polling Data are the publicly reported data on polls that we were able to find and collect.  We tried to collect many different metrics and blank spaces indicate missing data due to non-reporting of the information.

3) The data included in Other Data include state-specific files that were shared with the Task Force (in 2020 General State Level Polls) as well as other data that was used.  If there is data referenced in the report that is not included, let me know at _josh.clinton@vanderbilt.edu_ and I will see if I can find it.

4) I excluded voter-file data because that data was proprietary.

5) If you find errors in the data or the code please let me know.
